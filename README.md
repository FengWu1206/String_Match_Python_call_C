# String_Match_Python_call_C
String Matching Algorithm Harpool BM using python to call C.
This project provide a example of python call C to realize string match.

the API is 
[result, number] = search(pattern, text)
result---True means pattern in text
result---False means pattern not in text

The efficiency of Harpool BM with C is 5-times than that with Python.

Test Result:
For 147 file document.(text) 40 short document.(pattern).
The algorithm claculation time is 0.03s.
